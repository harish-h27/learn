## Docker Network
The network is nothing but an area that allows somebody to reach others
with defined permissions and protocols.     


#### Network terminologies and commands #
There are some terminologies used in Networking. Some of them are:     

```
Hostname: This is the most-frequently-used word. It’s the name of the
machine to identify it in a network.     

ping:  ping <hostname>/<ip>  command is used to check the connectivity of
machine from the machine from which the command is run.         

subnet: This is a small isolated part of a network. It is like creating boundaries
to a particular part in the same network.         

DNS: This is like a phone directory. All the reachable hosts are mapped in this
domain name service/system using IP and hostname so that you can either    
reach them by name or IP.

/etc/hosts: This is the important file. This file has all the reachable hosts with
their IP addresses. We will frequently refer to this file.    
```

#### Docker communication 
As you can see in the diagram, we have connected the container’s port 5000 to the
host’s 5000 and as a result, we can access whatever is running on the 5000 port on
the container.         
Coming to the database container, it will be in the same network as our app
container. Hence, we can access the database from our app container.    
Since there is no interface to the database container from the host machine, we
won’t be able to access the DB from the host machine. If needed, we can create an
interface and access it from the host.    


***By default, all containers run in the default network space of Docker. Hence, every container can communicate with others. We can create network isolation if it is needed***


#### Docker network types
By default, Docker creates three networks.
```yaml
$ docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE
915fe26ffbc8        bridge              bridge              local
3ac2c0505d62        host                host                local
753c94184c7b        none                null                local
```
When you initially install Docker, the platform automatically configures three
different networks that are named none, host, and bridge.    

The none and host networks cannot be removed, they’re part of the network stack
in Docker, but not useful to network administrators since they have no external
interfaces to configure.    

Admins can configure the bridge network, also known as the Docker0 network.
This network automatically creates an IP subnet and gateway.    

All containers that belong to this network are part of the same subnet, so
communication between containers in this network can occur via IP addressing.    

***A drawback of the default bridge network is that automatic service discovery of containers using DNS is not supported. Therefore, if you want containers that belong to the default network to be able to talk to each other, you must use the --link option to statically allow communications to occur. Additionally, communication requires port forwarding between containers.***




#### To list all Docker networks on your system, use the following command:
```yaml
docker network ls
```

#### To create a new Docker network, use the docker network create command. For example, to create a bridge network named my-bridge-network:
```yaml
docker network create my-bridge-network
```

#### To inspect a Docker network and view detailed information about it.
```yaml
docker network inspect my-bridge-network
```

#### To connect a running container to a Docker network, use the docker network connect command. For example, to connect a container named my-container to the my-bridge-network network:
```yaml
docker network connect my-bridge-network my-container
```

To Disconnect 
```yaml
docker network disconnect my-bridge-network my-container
```

#### To remove docker container
```yaml
docker network rm my-bridge-network
```






##### Here's an example docker-compose.yml file that runs four Docker containers (frontend, backend, redis, and postgresql) on the same network. This file ensures that only the frontend port is exposed to the host machine while allowing the frontend to connect to the backend, and the backend to connect to both the redis and postgresql containers.


```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:80"  # Exposing frontend port 80 to host port 8080
    networks:
      - app-network
    environment:
      - BACKEND_URL=http://backend:8080  # URL to access the backend service
    depends_on:
      - backend

  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    networks:
      - app-network
    environment:
      - REDIS_URL=redis:6379  # URL to access the redis service
      - DB_URL=postgresql://exampleuser:examplepass@postgresql:5432/exampledb  # URL to access the PostgreSQL service
    depends_on:
      - redis
      - postgresql

  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    networks:
      - app-network

  postgresql:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: exampleuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: examplepass
      POSTGRES_DB: exampledb
    networks:
      - app-network

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge
```

### Creating multiple applications in same network

**Here's an example docker-compose.yml file that runs four Docker containers (frontend, backend, redis, and postgresql) on the same network. This file ensures that only the frontend port is exposed to the host machine while allowing the frontend to connect to the backend, and the backend to connect to both the redis and postgresql containers.**

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:80"  # Exposing frontend port 80 to host port 8080
    networks:
      - app-network
    environment:
      - BACKEND_URL=http://backend:8080  # URL to access the backend service
    depends_on:
      - backend

  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    networks:
      - app-network
    environment:
      - REDIS_URL=redis:6379  # URL to access the redis service
      - DB_URL=postgresql://exampleuser:examplepass@postgresql:5432/exampledb  # URL to access the PostgreSQL service
    depends_on:
      - redis
      - postgresql

  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    networks:
      - app-network

  postgresql:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: exampleuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: examplepass
      POSTGRES_DB: exampledb
    networks:
      - app-network

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge
```


#### Network Definition:
In Docker Compose, you can define custom networks and configure their settings. This allows you to control how your containers communicate with each other and with the outside world.        

```yaml
networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge
```
This creates a custom network named app-network using the default bridge driver. The bridge driver creates a private internal network on your host system that is used for container communication.        


```yaml
networks:
  dcb_bank_otc_net:
    external: true
```
This indicates that the network dcb_bank_otc_net is an existing network that was created outside of this Docker Compose file.
**By specifying external: true, Docker Compose does not attempt to create the network itself. Instead, it expects the network to already exist in Docker’s network management system.**
#### Use Case
**Shared Networks**: When you have multiple Docker Compose projects or standalone containers that need to share the same network, you define the network as external. This allows different Docker Compose files to connect to the same existing network.    

**Network Reuse:** If you have already set up a network manually using Docker commands or through another Compose file, you can use external: true to avoid creating a duplicate network.    















#### Assigning Networks to Services:
Each service in your docker-compose.yml file can be assigned to one or more networks. By specifying a network under networks for a service, you're telling Docker that this service should be connected to that network.    

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    networks:
      - app-network

  backend:
    networks:
      - app-network

  redis:
    networks:
      - app-network

  postgresql:
    networks:
      - app-network
```

Here, all services (frontend, backend, redis, postgresql) are connected to the app-network. This means they can communicate with each other over this network.    

#### How It Works:

**Internal Communication**: Services on the same network can communicate with each other using their service names. For example, frontend can access backend using the hostname backend.    
**Isolation**: Services on different networks are isolated from each other. If you need to isolate certain services, you can create multiple networks and connect services only to the networks they need to communicate with.    
**External Access**: By default, containers are not accessible from outside the host network unless you explicitly expose ports using the ports directive.    



#### depends_on Key
**Purpose**: Ensures that certain services start before others.
**Use Case**: Useful when one service needs another service to be up and running before it starts.
**Example**
In your docker-compose.yml, if you have:
```yaml
services:
  backend:
    depends_on:
      - redis
      - postgresql
```
**What It Does**: The backend service will wait for the redis and postgresql services to start before it starts itself.
