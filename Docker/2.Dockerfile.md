## Dockerfile

The Docker engine executes all commands on your behalf, but we need to tell
Docker what commands we want to execute. So, Docker has something called a
Dockerfile. All the steps mentioned in the Dockerfile are executed step by step

```yaml
# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM node:14 AS builder
LABEL stage=builder

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve the application using nginx
FROM nginx:alpine
LABEL stage=production

# Copy the built application from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 to the outside world
EXPOSE 80

# Set environment variable
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Define the user to run the container
USER nginx

# Start nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

# Add a health check for the container
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1

# Add a metadata label
LABEL version="1.0" maintainer="example@example.com"

# Create a mount point with a volume
VOLUME ["/data"]

# Define the shell to use for RUN commands
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]

# Use ARG for build-time variables
ARG BUILD_VERSION=1.0
RUN echo "Build version: ${BUILD_VERSION}"
```

# Explanation of Each Command


1. FROM node:14 AS builder
    * Uses the Node.js 14 image as the base for the first stage of the build.
    * AS builder names this stage for reference in later stages.
2. LABEL stage=builder
    * Adds metadata to the image indicating it's the builder stage.
3. WORKDIR /app
    * Sets /app as the working directory for the following instructions.
4. COPY package*.json ./
    * Copies package.json and package-lock.json to /app.
5. RUN npm install
    * Installs dependencies from package.json.
6. COPY . .
    * Copies the rest of the application code into /app.
7. RUN npm run build
    * Builds the application using the build script defined in package.json.
8. FROM nginx:alpine
    * Starts a new stage with the Nginx Alpine image for serving the application.
9. LABEL stage=production
    * Adds metadata indicating this is the production stage.
10. COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
    * Copies the build output from the builder stage to the Nginx serving directory.
11. EXPOSE 80
    * Documents that the container listens on port 80.
    * Just because we expose port 80 that doesnt mean we can directly listen on port 80 from host machine for that you have to do port mapping either in docker-compose.yaml or in run command
    ```yaml docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-node-app```

12. ENV NODE_ENV=production
    * Sets an environment variable NODE_ENV to production.
13. USER nginx
    * Runs the container as the nginx user for better security.
14. CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
    * Sets the default command to run Nginx in the foreground.
15. HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1
    * Adds a health check to ensure the container is running properly.
16. LABEL version="1.0" maintainer="example@example.com"
    * Adds metadata labels with version and maintainer information.
17. VOLUME ["/data"]
    * Creates a mount point at /data for external volumes.
18. SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
    * Uses /bin/bash for executing RUN commands.
19. ARG BUILD_VERSION=1.0
    * Defines a build-time variable BUILD_VERSION with a default value.
20. RUN echo "Build version: ${BUILD_VERSION}"
    * Prints the build version during the build process.




# Layer Caching Overview:

**Layer Creation**: Each command in a Dockerfile (e.g., RUN, COPY) creates a new layer.   
**Caching Behavior**: Docker caches these layers to speed up future builds by reusing layers that haven’t changed.    

## Build Process:

**Initial Build**:
```
Docker builds each layer from scratch.    
Example log:    
    [1/4] FROM node:14    
    [2/4] WORKDIR /app    
    [3/4] COPY package.json ./    
    [4/4] RUN npm install    
```

**Modified Build**:
```
If you modify a line in the Dockerfile, Docker reuses the cached layers before the modified line.    
Example log after modifying RUN npm install:    
    [1/4] FROM node:14    
    [2/4] WORKDIR /app    
    [3/4] COPY package.json ./    
    [4/4] RUN npm install    
The log might show CACHED for layers that haven’t changed:    
    [1/4] FROM node:14    
    [2/4] WORKDIR /app    
    [3/4] COPY package.json ./    
    [4/4] RUN npm install  # Rebuilt if modified    
```
**Logs Explanation:**

```
    CACHED: Indicates that Docker used the cached version of the layer.    
    Running: Indicates that Docker is building the layer from scratch. 
```   
**Benefits**:  
```  
    Efficiency: Reduces build times by reusing unchanged layers.    
    Optimization: Focus on rebuilding only the necessary layers, improving overall build performance.    
```  

**Summary**:    
```
    In essence, Docker's layer caching mechanism helps streamline the build process by reusing previously built layers, making the build process faster and more efficient.
