```

To view listening ports for specific protocols (e.g., TCP or UDP):
```sh
netstat -lt   # For TCP ports
netstat -lu   # For UDP ports
```



## htop
The htop command is an interactive process viewer for Unix systems, similar to the classic top command but with a more user-friendly interface. It allows you to monitor system performance, including CPU, memory, and process usage
```sh
htop
```

## du
To get a summary of the total disk usage of the current directory:
```sh
du -sh
```
Display Disk Usage Including Hidden Files
```sh
du -ah
```
```sh
du -h /path/to/directory
```




## df used to check complete system disk usage

To show the output in a human-readable format

df -h
```


## systemctl 
The systemctl command is used in Linux systems to control and manage the systemd system and service manager. systemd is an init system and service manager that initializes system components, manages services, and handles system states. The systemctl command provides a unified interface for managing system services, sockets, devices, mounts, and more.


```sh
systemctl status nginx
```
```sh
systemctl start service_name
```
```sh
systemctl stop nginx
```
```sh
systemctl restart nginx
```
To enable a service to start automatically at boot time:
```sh
systemctl enable nginx
```
```sh
sudo systemctl disable service_name
```

To list all active (running) services:
```sh
systemctl list-units --type=service
```






## ssh , sshpass, scp 
```sh
ssh user@hostname
```

If the SSH server runs on a non-default port (default is 22):
```sh
ssh -p PORT user@hostname
```


Execute a Command on a Remote Server:
```sh
ssh user@hostname 'ls -l /path/to/directory'
```



Use SSH Key Authentication: To use an SSH key for authentication:
```sh
ssh -i /path/to/private_key user@hostname
```



### sshpass
sshpass is a tool that helps you use passwords for SSH (Secure Shell) connections automatically. Normally, when you connect to a remote server using SSH, you need to enter a password manually. This can be inconvenient if you want to automate tasks, like running scripts that connect to servers.
```sh
sshpass -p 'your_password' ssh user@hostname
```


Execute a Command Remotely:
```sh
sshpass -p 'your_password' ssh user@hostname 'command'
```




### scp 
Copy a File from Local to Remote: use (-r to copy directory)
```sh
scp /path/to/local_file user@hostname:/path/to/remote_directory
```


Copy a File from Remote to Local:
```sh
scp user@hostname:/path/to/remote_file /path/to/local_directory
```

Specify a Port: If the SCP server is running on a non-default port:
```sh
scp -P PORT /path/to/local_file user@hostname:/path/to/remote_directory
```




## ps, kill
The ps command displays information about active processes on your system.
```sh
ps aux
```
```sh
ps aux | grep python
```
```sh
kill PID
```
```sh
kill -9 PID
```





## rsync 

rsync is a powerful file synchronization and transfer tool used in Unix/Linux systems. It efficiently copies and synchronizes files and directories between two locations, whether on the same machine or between different machines over a network.


copying files locally
```sh
rsync -av /path/to/source /path/to/destination
```
Copying Files to a Remote Server:
```sh
rsync -av /path/to/local_file user@remote_host:/path/to/remote_directory
```

Copying Files from a Remote Server:
```sh
rsync -av user@remote_host:/path/to/remote_file /path/to/local_directory
```

Synchronizing Directories: To ensure the destination directory is identical to the source directory, you can use:
```sh
rsync -av --delete /path/to/source/ /path/to/destination/
```
--delete: Deletes files in the destination that are not present in the source.


Using Compression: For faster transfers, especially over slow connections, you can enable compression:
```sh
rsync -avz /path/to/source /path/to/destination
```

# awk 
awk is a powerful text processing tool that is used for pattern scanning and processing. It operates on a line-by-line basis, allowing you to manipulate and analyze text files and streams easily. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how awk works and some useful examples:

create a.txt 

username=johndoe
email=johndoe@example.com
age=30
location=New York
profession=Software Developer
salary=80000



Print all fields:
```sh
awk '{print $0}' a.txt
```

Print only the first and third fields:
```sh
awk -F'=' '{print $1, $3}' a.txt
```

Use = as a field separator and print the first field:
```sh
awk -F'=' '{print $1}' a.txt
```

Print lines containing "email":
```sh
awk '/email/ {print $0}' a.txt
```

Count the total number of lines:
```sh
awk 'END {print NR}' a.txt
```

create b.txt file 
username=johndoe
email=johndoe@example.com
age=30
location=New York
profession=Software Developer
salary=80000
username=janedoe
email=janedoe@example.com
age=28
location=Los Angeles
profession=Data Scientist
salary=90000


Sum all salaries:
```sh
awk -F'=' '/salary/ {sum += $2} END {print sum}' a.txt
```

Print lines where age is greater than 25:
```sh
awk -F'=' '$2 > 25 {print $0}' a.txt
```

Replace "New York" with "San Francisco" and print modified lines:
```sh
awk '{sub("New York", "San Francisco"); print}' a.txt

```
