AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning it uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.

RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm, which means it uses a pair of keys â€“ a public key and a private key. The public key encrypts data, and the private key decrypts it.


Decoding certificate
```sh
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout
```
