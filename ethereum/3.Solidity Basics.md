## Basics

### Using Etherscan with Metamask

1. **Metamask**: 
   - Metamask is a browser extension and mobile application that provides a cryptocurrency wallet.
   - It makes it simple to interact with DApps (Decentralized Applications) and to send/receive Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies (including layer 2 solutions).

2. **Etherscan**: 
   - Visit [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) and paste your Metamask wallet address to view transactions, token balances, and more related to your wallet.

### Remix IDE for Solidity Development

1. **Remix**:
   - Remix is a free Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for smart contract development.
   - It is available as an in-browser tool or a desktop application.
   - It supports Solidity development, which is the language used for writing Ethereum smart contracts.

2. **Workspace in Remix**:
   - A workspace in Remix is a collection of projects and files. You can create multiple workspaces to organize your projects.
   - Example Workspaces:
     - `office_workspace`: Contains office-related projects.
     - `personal_workspace`: Contains personal projects.
   - You can create any number of workspaces based on your needs.

3. **Creating a Workspace**:
   - Delete everything except the `contracts` folder.
   - Create a new file named `Helloworld.sol` with the following content:

    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0; // Compiler version should be between 0.7.0 and 0.9.0
    
    contract HelloWorld { // A contract in Solidity is similar to a class in other languages
        uint number;
        
        function store(uint256 num) public {
            number = num;
        }
        
        function get() public view returns (uint256) {
            return number;
        }
    }
    ```

4. **Compiling and Deploying**:
   - Choose the appropriate compiler version in Remix.
   - Compile the contract.
   - Deploy and run the contract using the Remix interface.

### Key Concepts in Solidity and EVM

1. **Pragma Line**:
   - In Solidity, the pragma line is placed at the beginning of a code file to indicate the Solidity compiler version(s) that can be used for this contract.

2. **Smart Contract Theory**:
   - **EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)**: The EVM is the runtime environment for smart contracts on Ethereum. It executes bytecode and ensures that smart contracts run as intended.
   - **Full Node vs EVM**:
     - A full node contains the entire blockchain and verifies transactions independently.
     - The EVM is a component within each full node that runs smart contracts.

### Steps to Deploy a Contract:

1. Write the source code as programmers.
2. Use the Solidity compiler to compile your program.
3. The compiler provides you with bytecode.
4. Send a transaction containing this bytecode to the blockchain (this requires gas).
5. The transaction gets mined, validated by the network, and added to the blockchain.
6. The EVM can then execute your code.
7. To interact with your contract, there are two methods: `call` and `tx`.
   - **Call**: Free interaction, doesn't alter the blockchain.
   - **Transaction (tx)**: Alters the blockchain and requires gas.


### Important Notes:

- The **state** is associated with the smart contract.
- Storing or modifying state costs money (gas).
- Modifying the state, sending money to the contract, or deploying a contract are all considered transactions.
- **Gas** is required to execute a transaction.
- Transactions are asynchronous and take time.
- A transaction doesn't return values, but you can listen to contract events to get updates.
- **Bytecode** is made up of **opcodes** (operational codes).
- **Opcode** is a low-level instruction understood by the EVM.
  - Each opcode is represented by two hexadecimal digits (hexadecimal means values ranging from 0 to F).
  - Solidity has 140 different types of opcodes.
    - Example: `01` is an opcode that instructs the EVM to read from the state.
- The number and type of opcodes in a smart contract influence the **gas price** required to execute it.











### Storage vs Memory vs Stack

#### Storage (aka State)
- **Definition**: Holds the state variables of a smart contract.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Permanent storage, meaning it persists on the blockchain.
  - The most expensive way to store data because it is stored directly on the blockchain.
  - Should be used to store data that needs to be permanent and accessible across different function calls.
  - Can store large amounts of data.

#### Memory
- **Definition**: Similar to RAM in a computer.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Larger than the stack but smaller than storage.
  - Used to store temporary data, such as function arguments and temporary variables.
  - Data in memory is temporary and is erased once the function execution is complete.

#### Stack
- **Definition**: A data structure used for storing temporary data within a smart contract.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Can store up to 1024 different values.
  - Each value can store 32 bytes of data.
  - Typically used to store local function variables.
  - It is cheaper than using memory, but limited in size.

### Transaction
- **Definition**: In the context of blockchains, a transaction (commonly denoted as "tx") represents a state-changing operation. 
- **Examples**: 
  - Transferring coins.
  - Invoking a smart contract.

### Call
- **Definition**: A free operation in the context of smart contracts that reads information from a contract.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Calls do not require transactions and cannot modify the state of a smart contract.

### Gas
- **Definition**: A fee required to execute transactions or smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Gas is paid in Ether and is typically denoted in Gwei (a small unit of Ether).

### Source Code
- **Definition**: The code written by the programmer, which is human-readable.

### Bytecode
- **Definition**: Program code that has been compiled from source code into a lower-level language that can be understood by an interpreter, such as the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).

### Deploying a Smart Contract

1. **Faucet**:
   - A faucet is a way to get free Ethereum on a test network. Each test network typically has its own faucet.

2. **Ethereum Network Docs**:
   - Visit the Ethereum network documentation to understand the process of deploying a contract and interacting with the network.

3. **Running Functions from Etherscan**:
   - You can directly run functions from Etherscan, interacting with deployed contracts on the Ethereum network.




### Data Types

- Solidity is a strongly typed language, meaning that each variable must be declared with a specific type, and type-checking is enforced during compilation.

#### Basic Data Types in Solidity

```solidity
contract HelloWorld {
    // Basic data types
    uint;          // Unsigned integer
    int;           // Signed integer
    bool;          // Boolean: true or false
    address;       // Wallet address (20 bytes)

    // Unsigned integers with specified bit lengths
    uint256;       // 256-bit unsigned integer
    uint128;       // 128-bit unsigned integer
    uint64;        // 64-bit unsigned integer
    uint32;        // 32-bit unsigned integer
    uint16;        // 16-bit unsigned integer
    uint8;         // 8-bit unsigned integer (1 byte, range: 0 to 255)

    // Signed integers with specified bit lengths
    int256;        // 256-bit signed integer
    int128;        // 128-bit signed integer
    int64;         // 64-bit signed integer
    int32;         // 32-bit signed integer
    int16;         // 16-bit signed integer
    int8;          // 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127)

    // Note: Each data type in Solidity has a default value. 
    // If you declare a variable without initializing it, you can still access it because it has a default value.

    int32 y = 8;
    int x = int8(y);             // Type conversion from int32 to int8
    address addr = address(0);   // Initializing an address to the zero address

    function getAddress() public view returns (address) {
        return addr;
    }

    // Single-line comment

    /*
        Multi-line comment
    */
}
```

### Operators & Type Conversions

```solidity
uint x = 10;
x = x / 7; // The return value will be in the type of `x`, which is `uint`.

int y = 9;
uint z = 10;

// The following operations will result in errors:

// z = z + y; 
// Error: You can't assign different types to one another (int to uint).

// z = z + uint(y); 
// Error: Since `y` could be negative, you can't directly convert a negative type (int) to a positive type (uint).

// Common Operators:
uint a = 5;
uint b = 3;

bool isEqual = (a == b);   // Comparison operator: equality
bool isNotEqual = (a != b); // Comparison operator: inequality
bool isGreater = (a > b);  // Comparison operator: greater than
bool isLess = (a < b);     // Comparison operator: less than
bool isGreaterOrEqual = (a >= b); // Comparison operator: greater than or equal
bool isLessOrEqual = (a <= b);   // Comparison operator: less than or equal

bool logicalAnd = (a > 2) && (b < 4); // Logical AND
bool logicalOr = (a > 4) || (b < 4);  // Logical OR
bool logicalNot = !(a > 4);          // Logical NOT

// Assignment operators:
a += b; // Addition assignment
a -= b; // Subtraction assignment
a *= b; // Multiplication assignment
a /= b; // Division assignment
a %= b; // Modulus assignment

// Type conversions:
uint8 smallInt = 8;
uint largeInt = uint(smallInt); // Convert small int to large int
int convertedInt = int8(y); // Convert one type to another using a constructor-like syntax
```

### Conditionals in Solidity

Conditional statements are used to execute different code based on different conditions. Solidity supports the standard `if`, `else if`, `else`, and ternary operators for control flow.

#### Example of Conditional Statements

```solidity
contract HelloWorld {
    bool canEdit = true;
    bool admin = false;

    // Simple if-else conditional
    function canEditDoc() public view returns (bool) {
        if (canEdit) {
            return true;
        } else if (admin) {
            return true;
        } else if (2 < 3) { // This condition is always true
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Nested if-else conditional
    function nestedifelse() public view returns (bool) {
        if (canEdit) {
            if (admin) {
                return true;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Ternary operator
    function ternary() public view returns (bool) {
        return canEdit || admin ? true : false;
    }

    // You can also use nested ternary operators:
    function nestedTernary() public view returns (bool) {
        return canEdit ? true : admin ? true : false;
    }

    // Example: Type casting errors in ternary operators
    function typeCastingError() public view returns (uint8) {
        uint8 x = 1;
        uint8 y = 2;
        uint result = x > y ? uint(10) : uint(20); // This will work correctly because the types are consistent
        return uint8(result); // Typecasting the result to uint8
    }
}
```

### Notes on Type Casting in Ternary Operators

#### Consistency in Types
- When using the ternary operator, the types of the true and false expressions must be the same or compatible. Otherwise, the Solidity compiler will throw an error.

#### Example of Type Casting

```solidity
uint8 a = 10;
uint b = 20;
uint result = a > b ? uint(a) : uint(b); // Explicit typecasting to ensure compatibility
```


### General Type Casting Rules & Errors

#### Implicit vs. Explicit Casting

- Solidity does not allow implicit type conversions where precision could be lost. For example, converting `uint` to `uint8` (which has a smaller range) must be done explicitly.
- Type casting is done using a constructor-like syntax, e.g., `uint8(someUint)`.

#### Potential Errors

- Attempting to cast from a larger to a smaller type without explicit conversion will result in a compiler error.
- Assigning a signed type to an unsigned type, or vice versa, without explicit conversion can lead to errors or unintended behavior.




#### Mapping (Key-Value Pair)

```solidity
mapping(uint => bool) map; // can't initialize
mapping(mapping(uint =>) bool); // wrong
mapping(uint => mapping(int => bool)); // Correct syntax for nested mappings

return map[key]; // If there is no value in the map, it will return the default value type

// Mappings can't be stored in stacks or memory
// So we can't create them inside functions
// But we can use mappings inside functions

contract HelloWorld {
    mapping(uint => int) map1;

    function x() public {
        mapping(uint => int) storage map = map1; // map references map1, but has no use and will cost extra gas
        map[0] = 1;
    }
}
```

**We can use mapping as a function parameter but only with the syntax below:**

```solidity
contract HelloWorld {
    function x(mapping(uint => uint) storage map) internal {
        // The keywords `internal` and `storage` must be used to pass a mapping as a parameter
    }
}
```


#### Function and Access Modifiers

```solidity
contract HelloWorld {
    uint x = 0; // By default, this is an internal variable 
    uint internal x = 0; // Explicitly declaring an internal variable
}
function x() public returns(uint) {} 
// public: Functions can be accessed similarly to public variables
// private: Similar behavior to private variables, not accessible outside the contract
// internal: Similar to internal variables, accessible within the contract and derived contracts
// external: This function can only be called from outside of the contract 
// Note: Cannot return inside a transaction

// Example of a function with return type
function x() external returns(uint) {
    return 1;
}

// Returning multiple values
function x() public returns(uint, uint) {
    return (1, 1);
}

// View function: A function that does not modify the contract state
contract HelloWorld {
    uint a = 1;
    function x() public view returns(uint) {
        a = 2; // This will throw an error because view functions cannot modify state
        return a;
    }
    // Within a view function, you can only call other view or pure functions
}
```
- **Internal**: If you declare a variable as `internal`, it can be accessed from derived contracts (inheritance).
- **Public**: Can be accessed from outside of the contract.
- **Private**: Can only be accessed within the contract and not from derived contracts.
- **Pure**: A pure function is a function that does not view, modify, or rely on anything within the contract. It is simply a function that performs calculations and returns a result.

  - **Characteristics of Pure Functions**:
    - Pure functions cannot use or modify state data.
    - Pure functions can only call other pure functions.
    - Pure functions can be called within any other function, but they do not interact with the state.
    - Pure and view functions cannot emit events.

- **Things That Can't Be Done in Both Pure & View Functions**:
  - They cannot modify the contract's state.
  - They cannot emit events.
  - They cannot write to the blockchain.
  - They cannot modify global variables.
  - They cannot access the `msg.sender` or `msg.value` properties directly to modify or rely on them.



























#### Global Keywords or Global Variables

- **`this`**: Refers to the contract itself or the instance of the contract.

  - **Get Balance of the Contract**:
    ```solidity
    function getBalance() public view returns(uint) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
    ```

- **`msg`**:
  - **Usage**: Mainly used inside functions.
  - **`msg.sender`**: Gives the address of the function invoker.
  - **`msg.data`**: Contains arguments specified or passed in that function.
  - **`msg.sig`**: Provides the first 4 bytes of calldata.
  - **`msg.value`**: Gives you how much ether was sent to the function during invocation or during smart contract deployment.

- **`block`**:
  - **Block Properties**:
    - `block.member`: Provides information about the block on which the smart contract is deployed.
    - `block.chainid`: Returns the chain ID of the current blockchain.
    - `block.gaslimit`: Returns the gas limit of the current block.
    - `block.difficulty`: Returns the difficulty of the current block.
    - `block.timestamp`: Returns the timestamp of the current block.
    - `block.coinbase`: Returns the address of the miner who mined the block.
  
  - **Usage in Pure and View Functions**:
    - You can use `block` properties in pure and view functions because these do not modify the state or write any data to the blockchain.

- **`tx`**:
  - **Usage**: When a contract initializes another contract or calls a sub-contract method from the main contract, using `msg.sender` inside the sub-contract will give the address of the main contract. This is because every contract has an address, and it's the main contract calling the sub-contract.
  - **`tx.origin`**: To get the sender (user) address from the sub-contract, use `tx.origin`.

  - **Most Usable Properties Inside `tx`**:
    - `tx.gasprice`: Returns the gas price of the transaction.
    - `tx.origin`: Returns the original sender of the transaction.

- **How Much Gas is Remaining in the Transaction**:
  - **`gasleft()`**: Returns the amount of gas remaining in the transaction. This can be confusing because it reflects the gas left at the point where it is called.



## Sending and Receiving Ether

### Units of Ether

- **Wei**:
  - `wei` is the smallest possible unit of Ether.
  - No floating-point values are used.
  
- **Gwei**:
  - `1 Gwei = 1e9 wei`
  
- **Ether**:
  - `1 Ether = 1e18 wei`

- **Usage in Code**:
  - You can directly use `wei`, `gwei`, and `ether` in Solidity code.
    ```solidity
    uint x = 1 wei;
    uint y = 1 gwei;
    ```

### Receiving Ether

- **Using `receive()` Function**:
  - The `receive()` function is a special function in Solidity.
  - It is automatically called when Ether is sent to a smart contract, provided `msg.data` is empty.
  - Note: This is not the only way to receive Ether; any payable function can also receive Ether.

  - **Example**:
    ```solidity
    contract HelloWorld {
        uint public received;

        receive() external payable {
            received += msg.value;
        }
    }
    ```

- **Testing in Remix**:
  - In the Remix IDE, change the value to `100` and click on "Transact" at the bottom to send Ether to the contract.

## Fallback Function

- **Fallback Function**:
  - The fallback function is a special function in Solidity.
  - It is not only for receiving Ether but also gets called in scenarios where Ether is sent to the smart contract and `msg.data` is not empty.
  - Think of the fallback function as an "else" or "default" case; if your contract does not handle the previous cases, this function will be called.

- **When Fallback Function is Triggered**:
  1. **When Ether is sent with non-empty `msg.data`**: The fallback function will be triggered.
  2. **When calling a non-existent function**: If someone tries to call a function that does not exist in the smart contract, the fallback function will be triggered.

- **Example**:
```solidity
  uint public fallbackReceived;

  fallback() external payable {
      fallbackReceived += msg.value;
  }
```

- **Testing in Remix**:
    - Add some data in the calldata and click on the "Transact" button to trigger the fallback function.








#### Creating Custom Function to Receive Ether

```solidity
uint public payReceived;
function pay() external payable {
    payReceived += msg.value;
}
```

If there is no `receive` function and someone invokes any function and tries to send Ether without using the custom function (with or without data), then it will be handled by the fallback function.

#### Sending Ether from the Contract

**1st Way (Not Recommended)**

```solidity
function withdraw() public {
    address payable user = payable(msg.sender); // this user is both address type & payable type, which gives us the send function below
    bool sent = user.send(address(this).balance); // sent will be true if send is successful & false if it is unsuccessful
}
receive() external payable {} 
fallback() external payable {} 
// to receive Ether to the contract 
```

**2nd Way (Not Recommended)**

```solidity 
function withdraw() public {
    address payable user = payable(msg.sender);
    user.transfer(address(this).balance);
    // The only difference between send and transfer is that transfer doesn't return anything
    receive() external payable {} 
    fallback() external payable {} 
}
```

Both transfer and send have a gas limit of 2300 (this needs to be clarified).

**3rd Way (Best Approach)**

```solidity
function withdraw() public {
    address payable user = payable(msg.sender);
    (bool sent, bytes memory data) = user.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
    // sent will be true if the call is successful, & false if it is unsuccessful
}
```

#### Re-Entrancy Attacks

- What is it, how it works with an example, and how to solve this.
- Sending money to other users from a contract is risky, so we have to take many security measures.

#### Re-Entrancy Attacks

- Sending money to other users from a contract is risky, so we have to take many security measures.

#### Re-Entrancy Attacks

- **What is it?**
  - A re-entrancy attack occurs when a malicious contract repeatedly calls a vulnerable contract before the previous function execution is complete. This can lead to the vulnerable contract's state being manipulated in unintended ways, often resulting in the loss of funds.

- **How it works (with an example):**
  - Consider a vulnerable contract that sends Ether to a user and then updates the user’s balance. If the transfer of Ether triggers the `fallback` function of a malicious contract, the attacker can make recursive calls to the vulnerable contract before the balance is updated. This way, the attacker can withdraw more funds than they are entitled to.

  Example:
  ```solidity
  contract VulnerableContract {
      mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

      function withdraw() public {
          uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
          require(amount > 0);
          
          (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
          require(success);
          
          balances[msg.sender] = 0;
      }

      function deposit() public payable {
          balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
      }
  }
  ```

  - In this example, the attacker can repeatedly call the `withdraw()` function through their fallback function before `balances[msg.sender]` is set to `0`, allowing them to drain the contract.

- **How to solve this:**
  - Use the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern: First check conditions, then update the contract state, and finally interact with other contracts (like transferring funds). This ensures that the contract’s state is updated before any external calls are made.

  - Example of a secured contract:
    ```solidity
    contract SecuredContract {
        mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

        function withdraw() public {
            uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
            require(amount > 0);
            
            balances[msg.sender] = 0;  // State change happens before transfer
            
            (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
            require(success);
        }

        function deposit() public payable {
            balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        }
    }
    ```

  - Limit gas forwarded during external calls: This can prevent re-entrancy attacks by limiting the amount of gas available for the fallback function, thus reducing the risk of re-entrancy.

  - Use `ReentrancyGuard` from OpenZeppelin's library: This is a contract that helps to prevent re-entrancy attacks by using a "non-reentrant" modifier.

  - Example:
    ```solidity
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

    contract SecuredContract is ReentrancyGuard {
        mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

        function withdraw() public nonReentrant {
            uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
            require(amount > 0);
            
            balances[msg.sender] = 0;
            
            (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
            require(success);
        }

        function deposit() public payable {
            balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        }
    }
    ```

- **Conclusion:**
  - Re-entrancy attacks are a serious vulnerability in smart contracts, but by following best practices such as the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern, limiting gas, and using established libraries like OpenZeppelin, developers can significantly reduce the risk of such attacks.























#### Exceptions and Errors

- If a runtime error occurs during a transaction, the state will be reverted back to what it was before the transaction, almost as if the transaction never happened.

#### `require`

```solidity
require(balance >= amount); // If this is true, then the execution of code continues. If it is false, then execution will stop & state is restored back to the original state.

require(balance >= amount, "balance is not sufficient"); // Error message
```

#### `assert`

- An assertion should not fail, while a `require` can fail.
- If an assertion fails, you can assume your contract has a serious bug.
- The `require` statement refunds the gas fee (remaining gas of what is sent to the transaction, or gas sent minus gas used until `assert`).
- `assert` does not refund the gas fee.
- Both `assert` and `require` will stop execution if conditions are not met.

```solidity
assert(balances[msg.sender] == balance - amount);
```

#### `revert`

- Just like `require` but without a condition.
- It will simply stop execution & revert the state.

**Custom Error Using `revert`**

```solidity
error BalanceNotLargeEnough(uint balance, uint amount);
error BalanceNotEnough();

contract HelloWorld {
    mapping(address => uint) balances;

    function deposit() external payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        uint balance = balances[msg.sender];
        require(balance >= amount, "balance is not sufficient");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: amount}("");
        if (!sent) {
            revert();
            // or 
            // revert BalanceNotEnough();
            // revert BalanceNotLargeEnough(balance, amount); 
            // These args balance and amount will be thrown to logs along with the error, making debugging easier
        }
    }
}
```

- The `revert` statement returns all unused gas and reverts the state to the original state.
- **Question:** What is meant by unused gas? In a transaction with a gas limit of 30,000, if 1,000 gas is utilized until `revert` or `require`, does it return 29,000 gas or all 30,000 gas?

#### Constructor

- You cannot explicitly call it.
- Runs once when the contract is deployed.

**Simple Program Where Everyone Pays & Only the Owner Withdraws:**

```solidity
contract HelloWorld {
    address public owner;
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    receive() external payable {};
    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "you are not the owner");
        require(address(this).balance >= amount, "not enough balance");
        (bool sent, ) = payable(owner).call{value: amount}("");
        require(sent, "failed to send");
    }
}
```



#### Self Destruct

- **What is Self Destruct?**
  - The `selfdestruct` function in Solidity is used to delete the contract from the blockchain. When a contract is destroyed, it can no longer be interacted with, but its previous state remains on the blockchain as historical data.
  
- **How is it used?**
  - `selfdestruct(payable(owner));`
  - This line of code deletes the contract and sends all the remaining Ether in the contract to the specified address, which in this case is `owner`.

- **Important Considerations:**
  - Once a contract is self-destructed, it cannot be recovered. The contract's code and storage are removed, but the transaction history and logs remain on the blockchain.
  - Self-destructing a contract is a permanent action, so it should be used cautiously, usually in emergency cases or when the contract’s purpose has been fulfilled.

#### Events

- **What are Events in Solidity?**
  - Events are a way for your smart contract to communicate that something of interest has happened on the blockchain. Clients (external applications) can listen to these events and react accordingly.

**Event Creation**
- **Example:**
  ```solidity
  event Bid(address indexed bidder, uint value); 
  ```
  - Here, an event called `Bid` is created, which logs the address of the bidder and the bid value.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Indexed Parameters:** Adding the `indexed` keyword to an event parameter makes it easier to search and filter logs. However, there can be a maximum of three indexed parameters in any event.
  - **Storage Consideration:** Indexed parameters use more storage on the blockchain, so they cost more in gas fees.

**Emitting Event**
- **How to Emit an Event:**
  ```solidity
  emit Bid(msg.sender, msg.value); 
  ```
  - Emitting an event is similar to calling a function. The event is stored in the transaction logs and can be accessed later for off-chain processing or notifications.

- **Why Use Events?**
  - Events are essential for transmitting information from the blockchain to off-chain applications. For example, when a bid is placed, an external application can listen for the `Bid` event and update its user interface accordingly.

- **Where to Declare Events:**
  - Events can be declared globally (at the contract level) or within functions. They are generally declared globally so that they can be emitted from multiple places in the contract.

#### Array

**Fixed Array**

- **Example:**
  ```solidity
  uint[5] numbers;  // Remember, uninitialized elements will have default values (e.g., 0 for uint)
  uint[5] number = [1,2]; // The rest of the array is filled with default values
  ```

- **Key Points:**
  - Fixed arrays have a predefined size that cannot be changed after declaration.
  - All elements are initialized to their default values.

**Dynamic Array**

- **Example:**
  ```solidity
  uint[] public numbers = [1,2];
  numbers.push(3); // Adds an element to the end of the array
  numbers.pop(); // Removes the last element
  numbers.length; // Returns the length of the array
  delete numbers[index]; // Resets the value at the specified index to the default value (e.g., 0 for uint)
  ```

- **Key Points:**
  - Dynamic arrays can change size during execution.
  - They allow operations like `push` and `pop`.
  - Deleting an element does not remove it; instead, it resets it to the default value.

**Creating Array Inside Function**

- **In Memory:**
  ```solidity
  function test() public {
      uint[] memory numbers;
      numbers.push(1); // This will fail because push can't be used with memory arrays
  }

  function test() public {
      uint[3] memory numbers = [uint(1), 2, 3]; // Correct way to create an array in memory inside a function
  }
  ```

- **With Dynamic Allocation:**
  ```solidity
  function test(uint size) public {
      uint[] memory numbers = new uint[](size); // Dynamically allocate a fixed-size array in memory
  }
  ```

- **Returning an Array from a Function:**
  ```solidity
  function test(uint size) public returns (uint[] memory) {
      uint[] memory numbers = new uint[](size);
      return numbers;
  }
  ```

- **Key Points:**
  - Arrays in Solidity are reference types, meaning if you assign one array to another, you are copying the reference, not the data itself.
  - When copying from storage to memory, the entire array is copied (creating a new array in memory).
  - When copying from storage to storage or memory to memory, the reference is copied.

**Array Usage Considerations:**

- Arrays can be expensive to use in terms of gas, especially if they grow large or if you loop through them extensively.
- Be cautious when using dynamic arrays, as they can grow indefinitely, leading to potential gas issues or even breaking the function.

**Nested Arrays:**
- Solidity allows for the creation of nested arrays, though the same gas and storage considerations apply.

























## Solidity Notes

### Strings
- **Nature**: Strings in Solidity are a reference type, which makes them less efficient for certain operations.
- **Example**:
  ```solidity
  string x = "hello world";
  string public y; // Default value is an empty string
  ```
- **Limitations**:
  - Direct index access is not allowed (e.g., `x[0]` is invalid).
  - Strings store UTF-8 encoded data.

### Bytes
- **Nature**: Bytes are used for storing raw data, making them more versatile for lower-level operations.
- **Example**:
  ```solidity
  bytes public z = "hello world"; // Declares a bytes array
  z[0] = "1";
  z.length;
  z.push("1");
  z.pop();
  delete z[1];
  bytes public y = "hello world";
  ```
- **Conversion**: You can convert between strings and bytes using a function:
  ```solidity
  function testString() public view returns(string memory) {
    return string(y);
  }
  ```

### Array of Strings
- **Example**:
  ```solidity
  bytes[] public y = [bytes("hello"), bytes("world")];
  ```
- **Conversion**: Strings and bytes values can be converted to each other when necessary.

### Loops
- **Caution**: Loops can be expensive in terms of gas and may pose risks if not carefully managed.
- **While Loop**:
  ```solidity
  while (true) {
    continue;
    break;
  }
  ```
- **For Loop**:
  ```solidity
  for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // Loop logic here
  }
  ```

### Program Example
- **Description**: This contract allows adding an address to an array of addresses if it's not already present.
  ```solidity
  contract HelloWorld {
    address[] public addresses;

    function addAddress() external {
      for (uint idx = 0; idx < addresses.length; idx++) {
        address currentAddress = addresses[idx];
        if (currentAddress == msg.sender) {
          revert("Sender is already in the address list");
        }
      }
      addresses.push(msg.sender);
    }
  }
  ```
















### GAS

**Gas Units**: It is an integer value that represents how much computational effort is required to execute specific operations. It is not a value that tells how much gas it costs us to run a transaction.

**Gas Price**: The amount of Ethereum that we are willing to pay per unit of gas. (Who decides what is the price of 1 gas unit?)

**Transaction Fee**: `gas units * gas price`
- It's the Ether or the actual cost you paid.
- Gas price is represented in Gwei.

- **Gas Price**: `base gas fee + tip or priority fee`
  - **Base Gas Fee**: Essentially a minimum value that we need to pay per unit of gas.
  - The base fee is determined by the volume of the Ethereum network. (Explain in detail)
  - In simple terms, the base gas fee means that if you want your transaction to be added to a block, you need to submit a minimum amount (base gas fee) of gas.
  - The base gas fee is burnt. (Why does token burning exist?)
  - **Tip**: The tip will go to the miner to prioritize your transaction, so they will process it faster.

**General Use Case Example**
- First, you offer the maximum Ether (Gwei) you are willing to pay to run a transaction. Here, your transaction fee is the maximum fee you offered, and gas limit = max fee.
- Then, the blockchain will process your transaction. If the transaction took a lesser fee than the maximum fee you offered or paid, the blockchain will refund the remaining fee to you.
- If the transaction fee (max fee) you offered is less than what is actually required to complete a transaction, then all the max fee offered will be consumed, and you won't get any refund. The transaction will fail, and the state will be reverted to the previous state.
- You need to set a higher max fee in every transaction so you won't run out of gas.
  - 100 gas = 100 Gwei
  - Per block, the Ethereum has a gas limit:
    - **Soft Limit** = 8,000,000

```solidity
contract HelloWorld {
  uint public sum;
  uint constant sumTo = 10000;
  function addIntegers() public {
    // this for loop will take a lot of gas
    for (uint i = 1; i <= sumTo; i++) {
      sum += i; 
    }
  }
}
```

**Let's divide the above code into multiple steps to lower the gas fee**

```solidity
contract HelloWorld {

  uint public sum;
  uint constant sumTo = 1000;
  uint start = 1;
  uint end = 100;
  function addIntegers() public {
    require(end <= sumTo);
    uint increment = 100;
    for (uint i = start;  i <= end; i++) {
      sum += i;
    }
    start = end + 1;
    end = end + increment;
  }
}
```
- You have to call `addIntegers` multiple times to get the result.
- How to know how much gas is consumed in this transaction?
  - `gasleft()` -> This function will give you how much gas is left.

```solidity
contract HelloWorld {
  uint public sum = 0;
  uint public gasLeft;
  function test() public {
    uint startGas = gasleft();
    for (uint i; i < 100; i++) {
      sum += i;
    }
    gasLeft = startGas - gasleft();
  }
}
```
