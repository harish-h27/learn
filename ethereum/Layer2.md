# Ethereum Scaling Overview

As Ethereum's user base grows, the network faces capacity limits, leading to higher costs and slower transactions. Various "scaling solutions" are being developed to address these issues. The main goals are to increase transaction speed (how quickly transactions are processed) and throughput (how many transactions can be processed per second) while keeping the network decentralized and secure.

## Types of Scaling Solutions

### On-Chain Scaling
*What It Is*: Changes to the Ethereum main network (layer 1).

- **Sharding**: Splitting the blockchain into smaller pieces (shards) managed by different groups of validators. However, layer-2 rollups have become the main focus because they are simpler and more effective for scaling.
- **Current Focus**: Layer-2 rollups and "Danksharding" (adding efficient data to Ethereum blocks).

### Off-Chain Scaling
*What It Is*: Solutions that operate separately from the main Ethereum network (layer 1).

- **Layer 2 Solutions**: Handle transactions off the main network but use its security.
  - **Rollups**: Execute transactions off-chain and then post the data to the main chain.
    - *Optimistic Rollups*: Assume transactions are valid unless challenged.
    - *Zero-Knowledge Rollups*: Use validity proofs to confirm transactions.
  - **State Channels**: Allow transactions off-chain and settle on the main chain later. Useful for fast, frequent transactions.
  - **Sidechains**: Independent blockchains connected to Ethereum, with their own rules and security.
  - **Plasma**: A separate blockchain linked to Ethereum, using fraud proofs to resolve disputes.
  - **Validium**: Uses validity proofs but stores data off the main chain, enabling very high transaction speeds.

## Why Multiple Solutions?
- **Reduce Congestion**: Distributes the load across different solutions to avoid bottlenecks.
- **Combine Strengths**: Different solutions can complement each other to enhance overall performance.
- **Diverse Benefits**: Some solutions offer unique advantages that others can’t provide.

The goal is to make Ethereum faster and cheaper to use while maintaining its security and decentralization.     
   
     




















    

# Optimistic Rollups Overview

Optimistic rollups are layer 2 (L2) protocols designed to enhance Ethereum's throughput by processing transactions off-chain. They offer significant improvements in processing speeds compared to other scaling solutions, such as sidechains and plasma chains.

## What is an Optimistic Rollup?

An optimistic rollup is a scaling approach that involves moving computation and state storage off-chain while posting transaction data to Ethereum. It works as follows:

1. **Transaction Execution**: Transactions are processed off-chain.
2. **Data Posting**: Transaction data is posted to Ethereum as calldata or in blobs.
3. **Batch Processing**: Multiple off-chain transactions are bundled together and submitted to Ethereum, reducing fees and utilizing compression techniques.

### Characteristics

- **Optimistic Assumptions**: Assumes transactions are valid and does not publish proofs of validity. 
- **Fraud-Proving Scheme**: Detects invalid transactions through fraud proofs. 

## How Do Optimistic Rollups Work?

1. **Transaction Execution and Aggregation**:
   - Transactions are submitted to operators who process and aggregate them.
   - Operators post transaction batches to Ethereum, either as calldata or in blobs.
   - Operators and validators use bonds to ensure honest behavior, with penalties for posting invalid blocks.

2. **Submitting Rollup Blocks to Ethereum**:
   - Rollup operators submit compressed data batches to Ethereum.
   - Data is posted as calldata (cheaper) or blobs (pruned after ~18 days).

3. **State Commitments**:
   - State is organized as a Merkle tree. State roots are hashed and stored on-chain.
   - New state roots are submitted with batches, allowing proof of inclusion for transactions.

4. **Fraud Proving**:
   - Disputed assertions are resolved using single-round or multi-round interactive proving.
   - Multi-round proving involves back-and-forth interactions between the asserter and challenger to resolve disputes efficiently.

## Interaction with Ethereum

### Data Availability
Optimistic rollups rely on Ethereum for storing transaction data, which is critical for verifying state transitions and constructing fraud proofs.

### Censorship Resistance
Ethereum helps prevent censorship by ensuring that data related to rollup state updates is publicly available. This enables users to withdraw funds and interact with the rollup even if the operator goes offline.

### Settlement
Ethereum serves as the settlement layer for rollups, providing finality and dispute resolution. Once a rollup transaction is accepted on Ethereum, it is considered final and cannot be rolled back.

## Asset Movement

### Entering the Rollup
- Users deposit assets into the rollup’s bridge contract on Ethereum.
- Assets are minted on the rollup and sent to the user's address.

### Exiting the Rollup
- Withdrawals require waiting through a challenge period (about seven days).
- Users can use liquidity providers to expedite withdrawals, paying a fee for immediate access to funds.

## EVM Compatibility

Optimistic rollups are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing:
- Migration of existing smart contracts to rollups without extensive modifications.
- Utilization of Ethereum’s infrastructure, including programming languages and development tools.

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: Up to 10-100x improvement in scalability.
- **Reduced Gas Costs**: Posting data as calldata or blobs lowers fees.
- **EVM Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing Ethereum tools and smart contracts.

# How Blockchain Bridges Work

Blockchain bridges are essential for transferring assets and data between different blockchains or between Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks. They enable interoperability and enhance the functionality of blockchain ecosystems.

## Steps in How a Blockchain Bridge Works

### 1. **Initiating the Transfer**

**Scenario**: Transferring an asset from Blockchain A (Layer 1) to Blockchain B (Layer 2).

1. **User Action**:
   - **Initiation**: The user decides to transfer an asset (e.g., ETH) from Blockchain A to Blockchain B.
   - **Request**: The user initiates the transfer through a bridge application or interface.

### 2. **Locking the Asset on Blockchain A**

**Action**: The bridge locks the asset on the source blockchain.

1. **Deposit**:
   - **Smart Contract Interaction**: The user sends the asset (e.g., 1 ETH) to a smart contract on Blockchain A.
   - **Locking**: The smart contract locks the asset in place, making it unavailable for direct use.

2. **Recording**:
   - **Transaction Confirmation**: The transaction is confirmed and recorded on Blockchain A’s ledger.
   - **Proof Generation**: A proof or receipt of the locked asset is generated for verification.

### 3. **Minting the Asset on Blockchain B**

**Action**: The bridge mints an equivalent asset on Blockchain B.

# Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups)

Zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) are layer 2 scaling solutions that increase throughput on Ethereum Mainnet by moving computation and state-storage off-chain. ZK-rollups can process thousands of transactions in a batch and then only post some minimal summary data to Mainnet. This summary data defines the changes that should be made to the Ethereum state and some cryptographic proof that those changes are correct.

## PREREQUISITES

You should have read and understood our page on Ethereum scaling and layer 2.

## WHAT ARE ZERO-KNOWLEDGE ROLLUPS?

Zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) bundle (or 'roll up') transactions into batches that are executed off-chain. Off-chain computation reduces the amount of data that has to be posted to the blockchain. ZK-rollup operators submit a summary of the changes required to represent all the transactions in a batch rather than sending each transaction individually. They also produce validity proofs to prove the correctness of their changes.

The ZK-rollup's state is maintained by a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum network. To update this state, ZK-rollup nodes must submit a validity proof for verification. As mentioned, the validity proof is a cryptographic assurance that the state-change proposed by the rollup is really the result of executing the given batch of transactions. This means that ZK-rollups only need to provide validity proofs to finalize transactions on Ethereum instead of posting all transaction data on-chain like optimistic rollups.

There are no delays when moving funds from a ZK-rollup to Ethereum because exit transactions are executed once the ZK-rollup contract verifies the validity proof. Conversely, withdrawing funds from optimistic rollups is subject to a delay to allow anyone to challenge the exit transaction with a fraud proof.

ZK-rollups write transactions to Ethereum as calldata. calldata is where data that is included in external calls to smart contract functions gets stored. Information in calldata is published on the blockchain, allowing anyone to reconstruct the rollup’s state independently. ZK-rollups use compression techniques to reduce transaction data—for example, accounts are represented by an index rather than an address, which saves 28 bytes of data. On-chain data publication is a significant cost for rollups, so data compression can reduce fees for users.

## HOW DO ZK-ROLLUPS INTERACT WITH ETHEREUM?

A ZK-rollup chain is an off-chain protocol that operates on top of the Ethereum blockchain and is managed by on-chain Ethereum smart contracts. ZK-rollups execute transactions outside of Mainnet, but periodically commit off-chain transaction batches to an on-chain rollup contract. This transaction record is immutable, much like the Ethereum blockchain, and forms the ZK-rollup chain.

### Core Architecture

The ZK-rollup's core architecture is made up of the following components:

- **On-chain contracts**: The ZK-rollup protocol is controlled by smart contracts running on Ethereum. This includes the main contract which stores rollup blocks, tracks deposits, and monitors state updates. Another on-chain contract (the verifier contract) verifies zero-knowledge proofs submitted by block producers. Thus, Ethereum serves as the base layer or "layer 1" for the ZK-rollup.

- **Off-chain virtual machine (VM)**: While the ZK-rollup protocol lives on Ethereum, transaction execution and state storage happen on a separate virtual machine independent of the EVM. This off-chain VM is the execution environment for transactions on the ZK-rollup and serves as the secondary layer or "layer 2" for the ZK-rollup protocol. Validity proofs verified on Ethereum Mainnet guarantee the correctness of state transitions in the off-chain VM.

ZK-rollups are "hybrid scaling solutions"—off-chain protocols that operate independently but derive security from Ethereum. Specifically, the Ethereum network enforces the validity of state updates on the ZK-rollup and guarantees the availability of data behind every update to the rollup's state. As a result, ZK-rollups are considerably safer than pure off-chain scaling solutions, such as sidechains, which are responsible for their security properties, or validiums, which also verify transactions on Ethereum with validity proofs, but store transaction data elsewhere.

### ZK-rollups rely on the main Ethereum protocol for the following:

- **Data availability**: ZK-rollups publish state data for every transaction processed off-chain to Ethereum. With this data, it is possible for individuals or businesses to reproduce the rollup’s state and validate the chain themselves. Ethereum makes this data available to all participants of the network as calldata.

  ZK-rollups don’t need to publish much transaction data on-chain because validity proofs already verify the authenticity of state transitions. Nevertheless, storing data on-chain is still important because it allows permissionless, independent verification of the L2 chain's state which in turn allows anyone to submit batches of transactions, preventing malicious operators from censoring or freezing the chain.

  On-chain is required for users to interact with the rollup. Without access to state data users cannot query their account balance or initiate transactions (e.g., withdrawals) that rely on state information.

- **Transaction finality**: Ethereum acts as a settlement layer for ZK-rollups: L2 transactions are finalized only if the L1 contract accepts the validity proof. This eliminates the risk of malicious operators corrupting the chain (e.g., stealing rollup funds) since every transaction must be approved on Mainnet. Also, Ethereum guarantees that user operations cannot be reversed once finalized on L1.

- **Censorship resistance**: Most ZK-rollups use a "supernode" (the operator) to execute transactions, produce batches, and submit blocks to L1. While this ensures efficiency, it increases the risk of censorship: malicious ZK-rollup operators can censor users by refusing to include their transactions in batches.

  As a security measure, ZK-rollups allow users to submit transactions directly to the rollup contract on Mainnet if they think they are being censored by the operator. This allows users to force an exit from the ZK-rollup to Ethereum without having to rely on the operator’s permission.

## HOW DO ZK-ROLLUPS WORK?

### Transactions

Users in the ZK-rollup sign transactions and submit them to L2 operators for processing and inclusion in the next batch. In some cases, the operator is a centralized entity, called a sequencer, who executes transactions, aggregates them into batches, and submits them to L1. The sequencer in this system is the only entity allowed to produce L2 blocks and add rollup transactions to the ZK-rollup contract.

Other ZK-rollups may rotate the operator role by using a proof-of-stake validator set. Prospective operators deposit funds in the rollup contract, with the size of each stake influencing the staker’s chances of getting selected to produce the next rollup batch. The operator’s stake can be slashed if they act maliciously, which incentivizes them to post valid blocks.

### How ZK-rollups publish transaction data on Ethereum

As explained, transaction data is published on Ethereum as calldata. calldata is a data area in a smart contract used to pass arguments to a function and behaves similarly to memory. While calldata isn’t stored as part of Ethereum’s state, it persists on-chain as part of the Ethereum chain's history logs. calldata does not affect Ethereum's state, making it a cheap way to store data on-chain.

The calldata keyword often identifies the smart contract method being called by a transaction and holds inputs to the method in the form of an arbitrary sequence of bytes. ZK-rollups use calldata to publish compressed transaction data on-chain; the rollup operator simply adds a new batch by calling the required function in the rollup contract and passes the compressed data as function arguments. This helps reduce costs for users since a large part of rollup fees go toward storing transaction data on-chain.

### State Commitments

The ZK-rollup’s state, which includes L2 accounts and balances, is represented as a Merkle tree. A cryptographic hash of the Merkle tree’s root (Merkle root) is stored in the on-chain contract, allowing the rollup protocol to track changes in the state of the ZK-rollup.

The rollup transitions to a new state after the execution of a new set of transactions. The operator who initiated the state transition is required to compute a new state root and submit it to the on-chain contract. If the validity proof associated with the batch is authenticated by the verifier contract, the new Merkle root becomes the ZK-rollup’s canonical state root.

Besides computing state roots, the ZK-rollup operator also creates a batch root—the root of a Merkle tree comprising all transactions in a batch. When a new batch is submitted, the rollup contract stores the batch root, allowing users to prove a transaction (e.g., a withdrawal request) was included in the batch. Users will have to provide transaction details, the batch root, and a Merkle proof showing the inclusion path.

### Validity Proofs

The new state root that the ZK-rollup operator submits to the L1 contract is the result of updates to the rollup’s state. Say Alice sends 10 tokens to Bob, the operator simply decreases Alice’s balance by 10 and increments Bob’s balance by 10. The operator then hashes the updated account data, rebuilds the rollup's Merkle tree, and submits the new Merkle root to the on-chain contract.

But the rollup contract won’t automatically accept the proposed state commitment until the operator proves the new Merkle root resulted from correct updates to the rollup’s state. The ZK-rollup operator does this by producing a validity proof, a succinct cryptographic commitment verifying the correctness of batched transactions.

Validity proofs allow parties to prove the correctness of a statement without revealing the statement itself—hence, they are called zero-knowledge proofs. For instance, if Alice produces a zero-knowledge proof to show her balance has been updated correctly, she must prove this while keeping her balance private.

ZK-rollups are primarily associated with zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs. Both are cryptographic proof systems that differ in terms of computational requirements and scalability. zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge) are compact and quick to verify, but require a trusted setup for generating proof parameters. zk-STARKs (zero-knowledge scalable transparent arguments of knowledge) are more scalable and don’t require a trusted setup, but proofs are larger and verification takes longer.

### Verifying Transactions

Validating transactions in ZK-rollups requires generating validity proofs to ensure that changes in the rollup's state comply with its rules. Once the rollup operator submits the validity proof for a batch of transactions to the Ethereum contract, the contract verifies the proof’s accuracy and accepts or rejects the state transition based on its validity.

## ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS

### Advantages

- **Efficiency**: ZK-rollups are highly efficient because they can process many transactions off-chain while only committing minimal summary data on-chain. This makes ZK-rollups faster and cheaper than other scaling solutions.

- **Security**: By leveraging Ethereum’s security model, ZK-rollups ensure that transactions are final and cannot be altered once processed.

- **Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs can maintain the privacy of transaction details while still verifying their correctness.

### Limitations

- **Complexity**: Implementing ZK-rollups is technically complex and requires advanced cryptographic techniques, which may be challenging for developers.

- **Data Availability**: While ZK-rollups compress data to save on costs, they still need to ensure that all relevant data is accessible and retrievable if needed.

- **Ecosystem Maturity**: The technology for ZK-rollups is still developing, and not all applications or platforms are fully compatible with this solution.

In summary, ZK-rollups offer a promising approach to scaling Ethereum by processing transactions off-chain and posting only necessary data and validity proofs on-chain. They combine efficiency, security, and privacy, making them a valuable tool for improving blockchain scalability.















# Understanding ZK-Rollups: A Real-World Example

## Scenario: Online Payment System

Imagine you're using an online payment system to pay for coffee at a local café. This payment system uses a Zero-Knowledge Rollup (ZK-Rollup) to handle transactions efficiently. Here's how it works:

## 1. Layer 2: Off-Chain Transactions

**Scenario:**

You and many other customers use the payment system to make purchases at various shops. All these transactions are processed off-chain on the ZK-Rollup, which operates separately from the Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1).

**Process:**

- **Batch Processing:** The payment system collects all transactions from the day into a batch. This batch includes your coffee purchase, other customers' payments, etc.
- **State Changes:** The payment system updates each user's account based on these transactions. For instance, your account balance is reduced by the coffee cost, and the café’s balance is increased.

## 2. Layer 2 to Layer 1 Communication

**Scenario:**

At the end of the day, the payment system needs to settle these transactions on Ethereum (Layer 1) for finality and security.

**Process:**

- **Generating Validity Proof:** The ZK-Rollup generates a Zero-Knowledge Proof, which ensures that all transactions in the batch were processed correctly. This proof is succinct and verifiable.
- **Submitting Batch Data:** Along with the proof, the payment system sends a summary of the batch data (e.g., state roots and batch roots) to the Ethereum network. This summary contains the essential data needed to validate and update the state.

## 3. Layer 1: Verification and Confirmation

**Scenario:**

The Ethereum blockchain needs to verify the batch of transactions and update its state based on the data received from the ZK-Rollup.

**Process:**

- **Receiving Data:** The Ethereum smart contract (ZK-Rollup contract) receives the batch data and the validity proof.
- **Verifying Proof:** The Ethereum smart contract verifies the zero-knowledge proof. If valid, it confirms that the transactions in the batch were processed correctly according to the ZK-Rollup's rules.
- **Updating State:** Once the proof is verified, the smart contract updates the Ethereum state to reflect the changes proposed by the ZK-Rollup. This includes updating account balances and ensuring all state changes are recorded.

## Summary of Communication:

- **Layer 2 (ZK-Rollup):** Processes transactions off-chain, updates account states, and generates a validity proof.
- **Layer 2 to Layer 1:** Sends batch data and validity proof to the Ethereum smart contract.
- **Layer 1 (Ethereum):** Verifies the validity proof, updates the state, and ensures all transactions are finalized and secure.

## Key Points:

- **Efficiency:** ZK-Rollups reduce the Ethereum network load by processing transactions off-chain and posting minimal summary data and proofs on-chain.
- **Security:** Ethereum ensures transactions are final and cannot be altered once verified.
- **Privacy:** Zero-knowledge proofs provide privacy for transaction details while proving correctness.

In essence, ZK-Rollups enable high-throughput and cost-effective transactions by leveraging Layer 1 security while performing the bulk of processing off-chain.



























# Comparing ZK-Rollups and Optimistic Rollups

## Overview

Both ZK-Rollups and Optimistic Rollups are Layer 2 scaling solutions designed to improve the scalability and efficiency of blockchain networks, particularly Ethereum. They achieve this by processing transactions off-chain and interacting with the main Ethereum chain (Layer 1) for security and finality. However, they differ in their approach and mechanisms.

## ZK-Rollups

### How It Works

- **Batch Processing:** Transactions are processed off-chain in batches.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** A cryptographic proof (zk-SNARK) is generated to validate the batch of transactions.
- **On-Chain Verification:** The proof and summary data are sent to Layer 1 for verification and state updates.

### Advantages

1. **Immediate Finality:** Transactions are immediately final once the proof is verified on Layer 1.
2. **High Security:** Zero-knowledge proofs ensure that all transactions in the batch are valid without revealing details.
3. **Efficient Data Posting:** Only the proof and summary data are posted to Layer 1, reducing data size and costs.

### Disadvantages

1. **Complexity:** Generating zero-knowledge proofs can be computationally intensive and complex.
2. **Latency:** Proof generation and verification can introduce delays, impacting transaction confirmation times.

### Real-World Example

**Example:** A decentralized exchange (DEX) using ZK-Rollups might process thousands of trades off-chain. At the end of the day, it submits a proof and a summary of trades to Ethereum. This allows users to trade quickly while ensuring that the trades are secure and verifiable.

## Optimistic Rollups

### How It Works

- **Batch Processing:** Transactions are processed off-chain in batches.
- **Assumption of Validity:** By default, all transactions are assumed valid and are processed without immediate verification.
- **Challenge Mechanism:** If someone suspects a fraud or error, they can challenge the transactions within a specific window. The Layer 1 chain then verifies the challenged transactions.

### Advantages

1. **Simplicity:** Easier to implement compared to zero-knowledge proofs.
2. **Lower Computation Costs:** No need for complex proof generation, which can reduce computation costs.

### Disadvantages

1. **Delayed Finality:** Transactions are only finalized after the challenge period, which can lead to delays in confirmation.
2. **Challenge Mechanism:** Users need to actively monitor for fraud and challenges, which can add complexity to the system.

### Real-World Example

**Example:** An online payment system using Optimistic Rollups might process daily transactions off-chain and assume all are valid. If a user believes a transaction is fraudulent, they can challenge it within a set period. The system only confirms transactions and updates the Layer 1 state after the challenge period expires or if disputes are resolved.

## Summary of Differences

| Feature              | ZK-Rollups                           | Optimistic Rollups                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Proof Mechanism**  | Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKs)     | Assumes validity, with challenge mechanism |
| **Finality**         | Immediate upon proof verification    | Delayed, depends on challenge period  |
| **Complexity**       | Higher due to proof generation       | Lower, simpler implementation         |
| **Cost**             | Reduced on-chain data and gas costs  | Lower computation costs               |
| **Security**         | Strong cryptographic guarantees      | Depends on challenge and fraud detection |

## Conclusion

Both ZK-Rollups and Optimistic Rollups offer significant benefits for scaling blockchain networks, but they cater to different needs and priorities. ZK-Rollups provide immediate finality and high security at the cost of complexity, while Optimistic Rollups offer simplicity and lower computation costs with a trade-off in finality and potential delays.





















# Validium

## Overview

Validium is a Layer 2 scaling solution that enhances scalability by offloading data storage and transaction processing from the Ethereum Mainnet. It uses zero-knowledge proofs, like ZK-rollups, to ensure the validity of transactions but does not store transaction data directly on Ethereum.

## How Validium Works

1. **Off-Chain Data Storage:**
   - **Transactions:** Transactions are processed and aggregated off-chain by a validium operator.
   - **Data Availability:** Transaction data is stored off-chain, reducing the load on the Ethereum Mainnet.

2. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:**
   - **Proofs:** Validium chains use zero-knowledge proofs such as ZK-SNARKs or ZK-STARKs to verify the correctness of off-chain transactions.
   - **Proof Submission:** Only the zero-knowledge proofs and state commitments are posted to Ethereum, not the transaction data.

3. **State Management:**
   - **State Commitment:** The state of the validium chain is represented by a Merkle root, which is stored in an on-chain contract.
   - **State Updates:** The validium operator submits new state roots and validity proofs to the Ethereum Mainnet to update the state.

4. **Deposits and Withdrawals:**
   - **Deposits:** Funds are moved from Ethereum to the validium by depositing into an on-chain contract, which then credits the validium chain.
   - **Withdrawals:** Users initiate withdrawals, which are processed by the validium operator. Once the validity proof is verified, users can withdraw funds to Ethereum.

5. **Data Availability and Proofs:**
   - **Merkle Proofs:** For withdrawals, users provide Merkle proofs that validate their transaction's inclusion in the validium state.
   - **Data Availability Managers:** Off-chain data is managed by data availability managers or committees to ensure data is accessible when needed.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- **Scalability:** Off-chain data storage allows Validium to process up to ~9,000 transactions per second.
- **Low Costs:** Reduced on-chain data footprint lowers transaction costs compared to on-chain solutions.
- **Fast Withdrawals:** Near-instant withdrawals with Merkle proofs for quick access to funds.

### Disadvantages
- **Data Availability Risks:** If off-chain data is inaccessible, users cannot generate Merkle proofs, potentially restricting withdrawals.
- **Complexity:** Requires robust mechanisms to manage off-chain data and ensure data availability.
- **Specialized Hardware:** Generating zero-knowledge proofs requires specific hardware, which can lead to centralization risks.

## Interaction with Ethereum

1. **Smart Contracts:**
   - **Verifier Contract:** Validates the correctness of zero-knowledge proofs submitted by the validium operator.
   - **Main Contract:** Stores state commitments and processes deposits and withdrawals.

2. **Settlement and Security:**
   - **Settlement:** Off-chain transactions are settled on the Ethereum Mainnet, providing finality and security guarantees.
   - **Security:** Ethereum verifies the validity of state transitions through smart contracts.

## Example Use Case

**Decentralized Exchange (DEX):** A DEX might use Validium for handling high-frequency trading transactions. By processing trades off-chain and only posting proofs and state updates on Ethereum, the DEX achieves high throughput and low transaction costs while maintaining strong security guarantees.

## Data Availability Models

1. **Data Availability Committee (DAC):**
   - A group of trusted entities that store off-chain data and provide proof of availability.
   - Risk: DAC members might be compromised or fail to provide data.

2. **Bonded Data Availability:**
   - Participants stake tokens to guarantee data availability.
   - Reduces centralization and relies on cryptoeconomic incentives to ensure honest behavior.

## Volitions

Volitions combine ZK-rollups and Validium, allowing users to switch between on-chain and off-chain data availability models based on their needs. This provides flexibility for different use cases, such as high-value trades or transactions requiring higher security guarantees.

## EVM Compatibility

- **Smart Contract Execution:** Validiums face challenges in supporting general computation and smart contract execution. Efforts are being made to optimize EVM-compatible languages and develop zkEVMs to support more complex applications.

## Conclusion

Validium offers a high-throughput, low-cost solution for scaling Ethereum by processing transactions off-chain and using zero-knowledge proofs for validation. It balances scalability and security while introducing trade-offs related to data availability and system complexity.









































# Comparison: zk-Rollups vs. Optimistic Rollups vs. Validium

## zk-Rollups

### Overview
zk-Rollups (Zero-Knowledge Rollups) bundle multiple transactions into a single proof, which is posted to the Ethereum mainnet. This proof, known as a zero-knowledge proof (ZK-SNARK or ZK-STARK), verifies the correctness of the off-chain transactions.

### Key Features
- **Data Availability:** All transaction data is posted on-chain (Ethereum mainnet).
- **Security:** High security through zero-knowledge proofs that verify the correctness of transactions.
- **Throughput:** High throughput by aggregating multiple transactions into a single proof.
- **Finality:** Fast finality due to all data being available on-chain.

### Advantages
- **Trustlessness:** Users do not need to trust any off-chain party for data availability.
- **Strong Security Guarantees:** Cryptographic proofs ensure that only valid transactions are processed.
- **No Fraud Proofs:** Immediate finality without requiring challenge periods.

### Disadvantages
- **Cost:** Higher costs due to the need to post all transaction data on-chain.
- **Data Bandwidth:** Limited by the Ethereum mainnet’s data capacity.

### Use Case
- Ideal for applications requiring high security and trustlessness, such as financial transactions and decentralized exchanges.

## Optimistic Rollups

### Overview
Optimistic Rollups also bundle multiple transactions into a single batch, but they assume transactions are valid by default. Instead of posting proofs, they use a fraud-proof mechanism where invalid transactions can be challenged within a certain period.

### Key Features
- **Data Availability:** Transaction data is posted on-chain, but not all data is immediately required for verification.
- **Security:** Relies on fraud proofs to detect and challenge invalid transactions.
- **Throughput:** High throughput by aggregating transactions but with a challenge period for invalid transactions.
- **Finality:** Subject to a challenge period where transactions can be disputed.

### Advantages
- **Lower Costs:** Potentially lower costs compared to zk-rollups due to not requiring all transaction data to be posted on-chain.
- **Scalability:** Improved scalability by reducing on-chain data requirements.

### Disadvantages
- **Challenge Period:** Transactions are subject to a challenge period, leading to slower finality compared to zk-rollups.
- **Fraud Proof Complexity:** The need for fraud proofs adds complexity and can be less efficient than zero-knowledge proofs.

### Use Case
- Suitable for applications where cost and scalability are prioritized over immediate finality, such as less sensitive or less frequent transactions.

---

## Validium

### Overview
Validium is a scaling solution that processes transactions off-chain and only posts zero-knowledge proofs and state commitments to the Ethereum mainnet. Unlike zk-rollups, Validium uses off-chain data availability.

### Key Features
- **Data Availability:** Transaction data is stored off-chain, which improves scalability.
- **Security:** Uses zero-knowledge proofs for transaction integrity, but relies on off-chain data availability.
- **Throughput:** Very high throughput with minimal on-chain data.
- **Finality:** Faster subjective finality, but data availability risks may affect users.

### Advantages
- **High Scalability:** Extremely high throughput and lower costs due to off-chain data storage.
- **Reduced Fees:** Lower transaction costs compared to zk-rollups.

### Disadvantages
- **Data Availability Risks:** Users may face issues if off-chain data is unavailable, affecting withdrawal and transaction verification.
- **Trust Assumptions:** Reliance on data availability managers or committees introduces potential trust issues.

### Use Case
- Ideal for high-throughput applications where off-chain data availability is manageable, such as gaming platforms or high-frequency trading.

---

## Summary

- **zk-Rollups** offer high security and trustlessness with on-chain data availability and immediate finality but can be costly and limited by data bandwidth.
- **Optimistic Rollups** provide a cost-effective scaling solution with a challenge period for fraud detection, offering improved scalability but slower finality.
- **Validium** excels in scalability and cost-efficiency by storing data off-chain but introduces risks related to data availability and trust.

Each solution has its own trade-offs and is suited to different types of applications and use cases.





















# Differences Between zk-Rollups and Validium

## Common Aspects

Both zk-Rollups and Validium:
1. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:**
   - They use zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-SNARKs or ZK-STARKs) to provide cryptographic evidence that a batch of transactions is valid.
   - **Proofs Submitted to Layer 1:**
     ```json
     {
       "stateRoot": "0x123abc...",
       "proof": "0xabcdef123..."
     }
     ```

2. **State Root:**
   - Both submit a state root, which is a hash representing the new state of the Layer 2 system after processing transactions.

## Key Differences

### 1. Data Availability

#### zk-Rollups:
- **Data Availability:** All transaction data and state changes are posted to Ethereum. This ensures that all data needed to reconstruct the state is available on-chain.
- **On-Chain Data Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "batch": ["TX1", "TX2", ...],  // Complete transaction data
    "stateRoot": "0x123abc...",
    "proof": "0xabcdef123..."
  }



#### Validium:
- **Data Availability**: Only the proof and state root are posted on Ethereum. The actual transaction data is kept off-chain, which reduces the data load on Ethereum but requires trust in the off-chain data availability.
On-Chain Data Example:
 ```json
{
  "stateRoot": "0x123abc...",
  "proof": "0xabcdef123..."
}
 ```
