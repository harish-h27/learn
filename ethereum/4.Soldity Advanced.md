#### Math and Arithmetic

- You can't represent floating point values in Solidity.

#### Overflow
```solidity
function testMath(uint8 x, uint8 y) public pure returns(uint8) {
    return x + y;
    // or
    return x - y;
}
```
- Older versions of Solidity don't handle overflow.

#### Import Statement
```solidity
import "url of the solidity contract";

SafeMath.add(x, y);
SafeMath.sub(x, y);

// There are many functions inside the SafeMath library; please use them here.

using SafeMath for uint;
function testMath(uint x, uint y) {
    return x.add(y); // Because of the above code `using SafeMath for uint`, we can directly use all SafeMath methods on uint types.
}

uint x = 2.9987e10; // This is valid in Solidity.
```

#### Time and Time Units
```solidity
function getTime() public view returns (uint) {
    return block.timestamp; 
}
// We can also do this:
block.timestamp - 7 days; // - 7 seconds, - 7 minutes, - 7 hours, - 7 weeks
```
- What is a timestamp?

**Simple Program to Make the Contract Invalid After a Minute**
```solidity
contract HelloWorld {
    uint expiry;
    uint count;
    constructor() {
        expiry = block.timestamp + 1 minutes;
    }
    function addone() public {
        require(block.timestamp < expiry); // Here I'm using `block` but I'm not creating any block in this transaction. What does this block mean?
        count++;
    }
}
```

**Get Minutes Since Last Call**
```solidity
contract HelloWorld {
    uint public lastTime;
    uint count;
    constructor() {
        lastTime = block.timestamp;
    }
}
```

#### Struct
- In Solidity, a struct is a typed collection of fields that can be treated like a custom type. Structs are useful for grouping data together.
```solidity
struct Person {
    string name;
    address addr;
    uint balance;
}
// Struct initializer
Person memory p = Person(name, msg.sender, msg.value); // Arguments must be in the same order as in the struct.

// Another way
Person memory p = Person({name: name, balance: msg.value, addr: msg.sender}); // Order is not required here.

Person memory p; // Empty initialization with default values.

mapping(address => Person) people;

people[msg.sender] = p;
people[msg.sender].name; // Accessing
people[msg.sender].name = "Harish"; // Setting
```

**Example Program**
```solidity 
contract HelloWorld {
    mapping(address => Person) people;
    struct Person {
        string name;
        address addr;
        Person[] friends;
    }
    function setname(string memory name) public {
        people[msg.sender].addr = msg.sender;
        people[msg.sender].name = name;
    }

    function addfriends(address friend) public {
        require(people[friend].addr != address(0), "Friend has not set a name");
        people[msg.sender].friends.push(people[friend]);
    }

    function getfriendsnames() public view returns(string[] memory) {
        string[] memory names = new string[](people[msg.sender].friends.length);
        uint numnames = people[msg.sender].friends.length;
        for (uint idx; idx < numnames; idx++) {
            names[idx] = people[msg.sender].friends[idx].name;
        }
        return names;
    }
}
```

#### Modifiers
- Imagine you have 5 functions, and each function should only be called by the owner. If you use the `require` function 5 times inside every function to check if the invoker is the owner or not, to avoid this repeated code, we can use modifiers.
```solidity
contract helloWorld {
    address owner;
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    modifier onlyowner {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _; // Very important
    }

    // The `onlyowner` modifier should be placed before `returns`, and this modifier will be called first, then the function.
    function test1() public view onlyowner returns(uint) {
        return 1;
    }
}
```
- We can modify the state inside the modifier, but the attached function should not have view-only access.

**Multiple Modifiers with Parameters**
```solidity
contract HelloWorld {
    uint public x;
    uint public y;
    uint public z;
    modifier costs(uint value) {
        require(msg.value >= value);
        _;
    }

    modifier greaterthan(uint value, uint min) {
        require(value >= min);
        _;
    }

    function setx(uint num) public payable costs(1 ether) greaterthan(num, 10) { // We can pass function arguments to modifiers as arguments
        x = num;
    }
    
}
```
- A function can have multiple modifiers, but that doesn't mean a function will be called multiple times; it will be called only once.
- The modifier syntax "_;" -> This will be replaced by the function. For example:
```solidity
modifier greaterthan(uint value, uint min) {
    require(value >= min, "Greater than");
    _;
    _;
    _;
    // In all the above `_`, we are replacing the function calls, so the function will be called 3 times.
}
```
- You can add extra code after `_`; it's valid.















#### Enums
```solidity
enum Status {
    pending, // 0
    shipped, // 1
    delivered, // 2
}

// Comparing
s == Status.Delivered;
// Setting
s = Status.Pending;
// Reset
delete s; // This will just reset the value to default.
```

#### Inheritance
- Except for private members in the parent contract, the child contract has access to everything.
```solidity
contract Storage {
    uint x;
    function setX(uint newx) public {
        x = newx;
    }
}

contract Child is Storage { // By comma-separated values, we can inherit from different contracts.
    function getX() public view returns(uint) {
        return x;
    }
}
```

#### Function Overloading
```solidity
contract Storage {
    uint x;
    function setX(uint newx) public {
        x = newx;
    }
    function getX() public virtual view returns(uint) {
        return x + 10;
    }
}

contract Child is Storage {
    function getX() public override view returns(uint) {
        return x;
    }
}
```
- The `virtual` keyword in the base contract function must be present to use the `override` keyword, meaning it will get overridden in the child contract.
- `Override` only works when both functions have the same parameter types, return types, and visibility modifiers.

#### Overloading with Example

**Super**
- To access parent members and functions inside a child contract, we can use the `super` keyword.
```solidity
contract Child is Storage {
    function getY() public returns(uint){
        return x + super.getX();
    }
}
```

**Passing Constructor Arguments from Child to Parent**
```solidity
contract Storage {
    uint x;
    constructor(uint startingValue) {
        x = startingValue;
    } 
}
contract Child is Storage {
    constructor(uint startingValue) Storage(startingValue) { // We are invoking the base class constructor inside the child class and passing the child class argument to the base class.
    }
}
```

#### Multiple Inheritance (Difficult)
- Both parent contracts can't have the same variable names or function names.
- The `super` keyword is still used because it searches both contracts A and B if we are inheriting from both A and B for methods and variables.
- Method overriding is possible in multiple inheritance.
- What is method resolution order?

#### Abstract Contracts
- You can't create an instance of an abstract contract.
- An abstract function is only valid inside an abstract contract. An abstract function doesn't have an implementation (body).
```solidity
abstract contract AbstractMath {
    function return1() public pure returns(uint) {
        return 1;
    }

    function getValue() public virtual view returns(uint);
    // The contract which uses this contract as a base contract must provide implementation for this function.

    function add5() public view returns(uint) {
        return getValue() + 5; // This is valid because we can't create an instance from an abstract class.
    }
}

contract Math is AbstractMath {
    uint x;
    function setX(uint _x) public {
        x = _x;
    }
    function getValue() public override view returns (uint) {
        return x;
    }
}
```

**Abstract Constructor**
- The constructor of an abstract class will have internal visibility because we can't instantiate an abstract class.
- You don't have to specify the keyword `internal`; it is optional. By default, the abstract class constructor will be internal.
```solidity
abstract contract Test {
    uint x;
    constructor(uint _x) {
        x = _x;
    }
}

contract A is Test(2) { // Another way of calling the base class constructor inside the child class.
}
```

**Interfaces**
- It is just like an abstract class but it cannot have any function implementation.
```solidity
interface ReturnsValue {
    function getValue() external view returns(string memory);
}

contract A is ReturnsValue {
    string str = "hello world";
    function getValue() external override view returns(string memory) {
        return str;
    }
}

ReturnsValue[] values = [ReturnsValue(new A())];
// If A had a different method, we can't access it from `values[0].<method name>` because that method is not part of ReturnsValue.
```
- Visibility modifiers inside an interface must be external.
- You can't define variables inside an interface.
- An interface can't have a constructor.
- No state variables inside an interface.
- We can have structs and enums in an interface, and you can access them using dot notation `ReturnsValue.myStruct`.

**Library**
- We can't have state variables inside a library.
- No state modifications.
- Every function inside a library must be pure or view.
- Using library functions doesn't cost anything.
- No fallback or receive functions.
- You can create structs and enums inside an interface.

- In Solidity, a library is a collection of reusable utility or helper functions. Libraries contain functions that are called by other contracts and can be deployed independently to save gas and avoid repeated code.
```solidity
library Math {
    function pow(uint a, uint b) public view returns(uint) {
        return a ** b;
    }
}
```










#### Contract Storage

**Storage**
- Permanent/persistent location.
- Stored on the blockchain.
- Expensive to write to.
- Free to read from externally.
- Even if a storage variable is declared as private, it can't be accessed outside the contract but is visible to everyone inside the blockchain.
- Can only be modified by the contract that holds the values.
- There are 2^256 slots for storage inside a contract.
- Each storage slot can hold 32 bytes.
- Storage slots can store multiple values/variables.
    - Example: If you have 3 `uint8` storage variables, they can be stored inside a single slot.

**Memory**
- Temporary location.
- Stored in RAM.
- Cheaper to write to.
- Mutable.
- Typically used for reference types.
- Cleared after function execution.

**Reference Types Usage**
- `memory` to `memory` = reference (when you assign a string that is in memory to another memory variable).
- `memory` to `storage` = copy.
- `storage` to `memory` = copy.
- `storage` to `storage` = reference.

**Calldata**
- Temporary location.
- Only stores function arguments.
- Behaves similarly to memory.
- Can be cheaper than memory.
- Immutable.

**Stack**
- In the context of the EVM/Solidity, the stack is a temporary internal storage location where variables are stored in 32-byte slots. It is used for small local variables and the value types of functions (i.e., the type of parameters and return values).

**Logs**
- Associated with transactions.
- Cannot be accessed by smart contracts.
- This is where event data is stored.
- A cheap data structure.
- Useful for returning information to the caller of a function.
- Accessed off the blockchain.

**Code**
- The code you write is also stored.
- The actual code of the contract.
- Stored on the blockchain.
- Constant variables are stored here (not in memory).
